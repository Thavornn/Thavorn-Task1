              Zermatt: The Alpine Jewel Beneath the Matterhorn Zermatt is one of
              Switzerlandâ€™s most enchanting destinations, nestled deep within
              the Valais canton in the south of the country, near the Italian
              border. What makes this town truly extraordinary is its backdrop:
              the Matterhorn, one of the most recognizable mountains in the
              world with its dramatic, pyramid-shaped peak soaring 4,478 meters
              (14,692 ft) into the sky. The mountain dominates the skyline and
              adds a magical quality to everything around it. <br />
              Car-Free, Carefree Charm Zermatt has a unique atmosphere thanks to
              its commitment to sustainability and preservation. The town center
              is completely car-free â€” only small electric taxis and horse-drawn
              carriages are allowed. This contributes to the townâ€™s peaceful,
              clean-air environment and makes wandering its charming streets a
              delight. The cobbled lanes are lined with traditional wooden
              chalets, boutique shops, gourmet restaurants, and cozy cafÃ©s
              offering hot chocolate, raclette, and mulled wine in the winter.
              Outdoor Adventures All Year Round <br />. Winter in Zermatt is a
              haven for snow lovers. The ski area, known as Matterhorn Ski
              Paradise, is one of the highest and most extensive in Europe, with
              over 360 km of pistes and connections to the Italian resort of
              Cervinia. Snow is virtually guaranteed thanks to the nearby
              glacier. You can even ski here in the summer. <br />
              . Summer transforms the landscape into a lush green wonderland
              perfect for hiking, biking, and climbing. Over 400 km of marked
              trails snake through the mountains, forests, and meadows. The Five
              Lakes Walk is especially popular for its serene alpine lakes, some
              of which reflect the Matterhorn perfectly on a calm day. Iconic
              Experiences <br />. Gornergrat Railway: A highlight of any visit,
              this cogwheel train climbs up to 3,089 meters (10,135 ft) for
              panoramic views of the Matterhorn and more than 20 surrounding
              glaciers and 29 peaks above 4,000 meters.
              <br></br>. Matterhorn Glacier Paradise: Ride Europeâ€™s highest
              cable car to this awe-inspiring viewpoint. Inside, there's an ice
              palace carved into the glacier and sweeping vistas that, on a
              clear day, stretch across to France and Italy.<br></br>.
              Mountaineerâ€™s Cemetery: A poignant and peaceful place honoring
              those who lost their lives attempting to climb the Matterhorn. It
              reflects the townâ€™s deep connection to alpine exploration.
